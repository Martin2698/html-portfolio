<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2H1lcyrRFw">1.LORD OF THE RINGS SAGA</a> </h3>
<p>
    How to even start with this one. Because if you haven't heard of these movies, you given me another reason
    to just want ot end my life sooner, and also makes me think that your imagination is just straight garbage.
    But these movies have it all and i mean all of it. From slaying dragons, killing orcs, wondering out in
    wilderness, to huge wars with armies from different races, exploring dungeons and "MAGIC". Literally
    everything start when an evil necromancer uses dark magic to build a ring that can other kingdoms but in reality
    he uses to build a bigger army to enslave all humanity but fail when literally the world teams up against him.
    but too much to say and i aint going to spoil this movie because "JUST NO"

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWWfslP0Vsk"> 2.HARRY POTTER SERIOUS</a></h3>
<p>
    This serious is my all time favorite so "yes" i am nerd. This serious is a "you must know this one" it
    has such huge fan base on it, ever since the books came out. The setting of these movies is just perfect like who else?
    just wakes up in the morning to his birthday while living with horrible family members who don't give shit about your
    birthday. Than all of the sudden you get a letter from hogwarts(whole ass wizard school of magic), that your uncle doesn't
    want you to go. so he moves you and his family to light tower in the middle of the sea, thinking he was safe from any letters.
    but than a huge fat giant breaks the door down to give you the same letter and with birthday cake that you didnt get piece from
    cz your fatass cousin dudley got to it first. while he's eating your cake the giant fatso tells you, that you are a very famous
    wizard that stopped an evil wizard that also killed your parents his name is "lord boldymort" i mean "lord voldemort". So in
    other words your famous in the wizarding world but a nobody in the muggle(non magic blood). i mean the amount of adventures and 
    plot twists including heartbreaking scenes, like come on where is my letter. the only reason is number 2 on this list is just tht
    they dont go much places.

<p>
    this one is also my all time favorite cz it has such a huge plot twist that to this day my heart still aches after i rewatch the saga
    for millionth time. it all start cz of an all time over powered jedi(monk that can use special powers) named anakin(a.k.a my favorite
    jedi) fell in love with a princess which as jedi you cant fall in love cz love is a dangerous feeling that can make u fall into the 
    darkside of the force. And they werent wrong for that cz he literally over threw the jedi council for secrets to keep his be loved padme
    from dieing at child birth "SCREW YOU ANAKIN"
